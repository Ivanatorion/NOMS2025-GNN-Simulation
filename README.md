# GNN NS3 Experiment
To run the experiments, place the folders from this repository in the ns3 installation directory, replacing the "scratch" and "src" folders.

After building ns3, the "gnn-header.h" file should be placed in the "build/ns3/" folder.

The "Experiments" folder contains a some bash scripts that runs all simulations from our paper and outputs the results to a "results" folder.
